I got some really nice and useful feedbacks from the mid-term. In general, one is about my choice of the material, another is the technical details.

There are some other problems as well, I put red circles in the poster about the points for improvement.

1. The window is not big enough if my first thought was to bring nature light and surrounding scenery inside of the house.
2. The concrete material is too heavy for my lifting idea, and my thoughts of using this material is not mature enough. Like the staircases is lack of support.
3. My section is lack of technical informations about the structure inside and the expression of insulation ways.
4. Because my kitchen is hidden beneath the kid's bed, but I didn't show it clearly in my plan. In other words, I can make an addtion plan at eye level to provide those missing informations.
5. The competition has a scoring criteria about sustainability, and I need to develop this part in my poster.
6. I have some interesting activities going underneath the building, but I didn't show them in the poster.
7. the layout of the poster can be improved as well, to better communicate with people who will watch your poster. I need to find a better way to vividly show the characteristics of architecture I want to convey.

The following days we will focus on the 3D printing, and updating the poster.
