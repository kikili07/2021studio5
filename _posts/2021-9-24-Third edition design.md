My ideas about letting other functional parts in the house to move didn't achieved the result of saving the space to a great extent, but kind of making the house layout a little bit messy. Therefore, I decided to go back to my last design that using moving part to save spave as well as divide the space.

Because of the weather and strong ultraviolet rays in Salt Lake City, I decided to add a big span roof on the top of the house to provide shade for the house and decrease the heat entry. Also, the size of the house plan is a six meters by six meters square, the hight of the house is three meters, and the overhead space under the house has three meters high, so the whole house is actually a cube. In order to break this little boring shape.
