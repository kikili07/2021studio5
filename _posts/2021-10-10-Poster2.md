After the first poster, I produce some new drawings.

I keep thinking what features of architecture are important and can help others to understand and discover the special things about my design.
In my design, the layout is actually normal, but the two moving cabinets is initial and special. In order to highlight this feture, I decided to use section to show its movement.

I also develop the plan. I found that for my design, the perspective plan is not much different from the ordinary plan, but the ordinary plan is more concise and clear.
Also the sections that are oriented in different directions, one is facing north, and another is facing south.

About the big rendering, the pervious one is bird view. In order to let others to actually feel the size of the building, I developed a person's view of the building at 1.7m high.
