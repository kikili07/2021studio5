My initial graphic design is actually a reflection of my personal preference.

Because My clients are young people. As a young person myself, I feel more like designing a house of my own. Like I perfer a sofa than a dining table, and I prefer a shower than a tube, etc. In order to save more space, I decide to use a moveable wardrobe to replace the "wall" of bedroom. I also put in a lot of things with the same angle, such as tables, walls and closets, so that they can echo each other and make the house more interesting.

My first plan was just a attempt. I learned from it that there are three indispensable parts of a house: bathroom, bedroom and kitchen. They don't have to be a room with four walls. They are just functional spaces.

On the basis of this cognition, I decided to develop the moveable wardrobe idea. Besides its space-saving function， I was thinking that why not let this moving part become a partition of the whole space, open and close the space through its movement. This "moving wall" can blur the definition of space and make the space appear larger.

About the exterior, this architectural project "Pilotis in a Forest House" in Japan really interests me.

The way it "define" the space on the ground is novel to me, Both clear and vague, you can feel the boundary of the space clearly by the pillars around, but still very vague feeling with such open position in the surrounding environment. The mobile cabinet indoors I tried to use is similar to this project, so I decided to absorb this kind of unique definition of the space.

In terms of material, in order to publicize the benefits of recycling, I personally prefer recycling concrete materials. Because most modern buildings use concrete, if this material is not recycled, it will become construction waste. The concrete is broken and recast in various forms of materials. A project in South Korea shows the utilization of recycled concrete very well, Hanil Visitors Center & Guest House.

This project uses recycled concrete and turns it into many forms of concrete, coarse concrete with gravel texture, as well as "flowing" smooth concrete, etc. I love this project using the canvas like concrete wall on the East facade to echo the intention of the nearby forest, also the combination of tough and soft is interesting. This project is a very good study for me.

I made a rough model， where I made some of the pillars in middle lean for small angles，to better echo the nature in surroundings.
