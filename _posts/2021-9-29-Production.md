Mundane Home
Home is a cozy, comfortable and relaxing place where poeple can feel belonging. I think if the necessary qualities of the house is ranked by importance, the order will be Securit Functionality, Comfort and Aesthetic. Different from house, home becomes warm because of the people who live in it, and the trivial, mundane things that happening inside spice up the "weight" of home. 

I think the applicable client is the young people, who just got independence from big family and exploring solitary life. Maybe with a cat and a dog.

For solitary life, life will be more colorful in a neighborhood, but in order to ensure the living standard, street will be too noisy. Therefore, I decided to put my site in woods, where is quite and beautiful.

For the design, my whole concept is to keep the house low energy consumption and environment-friendly, and live an extraordinary life in an mundane house. The design space is a 6 meters by 6 meters square, the plan area is 36ft. First, I decided to develop the moveable wardrobe idea for space-saving function. The moving part can become a partition of the whole space, open and close the space through its movement. This “moving wall” can blur the definition of space and make the space appear larger.

In terms of material, in order to publicize the benefits of recycling, I personally prefer recycling concrete materials. Because most modern buildings use concrete, if this material is not recycled, it will become construction waste, it can be broken and recasted in various forms of materials.

The idea of raising the house overhead is to reduce the ecological damage caused by the concrete foundation while opening the space below the overhead
