Tiny House Technology

I did research about the smart technology or furniture that used in tiny house, some aiming at saving space, while others aiming at saving energy. I chose following four technologies I might use in my own design.

1. solar panels blend in the roof of a house with no visual relationship with the rest of the structure. (Swedish company SolTech Energy)

2. wall-mounted washing machine which is compact at just one sixth the size of a normal washing machine. (Daewoo Electronics' Mini)

3. Rotating Countertop Extension. (SESTANTE)

4. space-saving bathtub, which is less than 3 kgs and juts out only 12-cms from the wall. (Sylwia Ulicka Rivera)
