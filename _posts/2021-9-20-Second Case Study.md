After approaching inital designs of the tiny houseAbout the exterior, interior and material, I also did many other cases studies. 

the exterior, this architectural project “Pilotis in a Forest House” in Japan really interests me. 

The way it “define” the space on the ground is novel to me, Both clear and vague, you can feel the boundary of the space clearly by the pillars around, but still very vague feeling with such open position in the surrounding environment. The mobile cabinet indoors I tried to use is similar to this project, so I decided to absorb this kind of unique definition of the space.

In terms of material, in order to publicize the benefits of recycling, I personally prefer recycling concrete materials. Because most modern buildings use concrete, if this material is not recycled, it will become construction waste. The concrete is broken and recast in various forms of materials. A project in South Korea shows the utilization of recycled concrete very well, Hanil Visitors Center & Guest House.

This project uses recycled concrete and turns it into many forms of concrete, coarse concrete with gravel texture, as well as “flowing” smooth concrete, etc. I love this project using the canvas like concrete wall on the East facade to echo the intention of the nearby forest, also the combination of tough and soft is interesting. This project is a very good study for me.

I made a rough model， where I made some of the pillars in middle lean for small angles，to better echo the nature in surroundings.
