This week, we began to design the layout of the poster. 

I searched some poster examples, and combine the drawings I decided to put in my poster, I came up with my first edition of poster.

I left some blank spaces in my poster to fill some other drawings later. For now, I only made one perspective view of the whole building, four elevations, one perspective plan and one perspective section. Some activities like sitting on floor and looking out for beautiful scenery outside,  folding clothes next to the hidden drawers inside of the bed, cooking in the kitchen and so on.
