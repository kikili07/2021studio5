In order to show them properly, I first show the activities that can happened in the open space underneath the living space, which I forgot to show in the last poster.

There are solar panels on the roof for energy collection, big windows for nice light condition, different height of narrow windows that can be open for better ventilation and slope roof for drainage.

It is also a good idea to put the photos of my 3D model, so I added a few.
