Background：The American Institute of Architects Utah Chapter (AIA Utah) and the Community Development Corporation of Utah (CDCU), in collaboration with Salt Lake City Corporation (SLC or City), together hold a competition about designing small residential structure or “Tiny Home.”

Mundane Home --- Kiki Li Yanqi

Definition of home：Home is a cozy, comfortable and relaxing place where poeple can feel belonging. I think if the necessary qualities of the house is ranked by importance, the order will be Security, Functionality, Comfort and Aesthetic. Different from house, home becomes warm because of the people who live in it, and the trivial, mundane things that happening inside spice up the "weight" of home.

Client: I think the applicable client is the young people, who just got independence from big family and exploring solitary life. Maybe with a cat and a dog.

Site: For solitary life, I think life will be more colorful with neighborhood, so I will choose site along the road, in a community.

Here is a potential site I choose in Salt Lake City
