My initial graphic design is common, which reflected some of my personal preference. Like I perfer a sofa than a dining table，and I prefer a shower than a tube, etc. In order to save more space, I decide to use a moveable wardrobe to replace the "wall" of bedroom.

Later, I decided to develop the moveable wardrobe idea. Besides its space-saving function， I was thinking that why not let this moving part become a partition of the whole space, open and close the space through its movement. This "moving wall" can blur the definition of space and make the space appear larger. 

In order to better understand and feel the space, the studio uses tape or chalk to display a 1:1 plan on the ground.
