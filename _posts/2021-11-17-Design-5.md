`Bubble Develpment`

We changed the shape of the bubble building. From translucent to fully transparent, which greatly broadens people's vision and makes closer contact with nature. Moreover, we have also increased the number of bubble buildings, so that it is not only a restaurant, but also has rich functions: housing, catering, retail, port and sea bubble rest place.

The road is divided into three levels to facilitate access to different bubble buildings.
