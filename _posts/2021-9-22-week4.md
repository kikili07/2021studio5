The moving part in perivous design is a nice way to safe space in tiny house, so I want to try letting some other parts to move as well.

Therefore, I tried three different ways of "moving" the house. In these three plans, I put bathroom in different places, and move the rest of the house in different tracks.

I also made few Mobile modules attempt and study. Each module has wheels that can move along rails. I thought putting some storage spaces into modeules will be nice, so I tried two ways, storage on top or beneath.

I made the model of the general layout inside of the house.
