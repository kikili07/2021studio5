`Design`

My partner makes an open tiny house on the first floor, and my design is a fully transparent bubble house. We combine the similarities between the two designs - transparent and open. So our unit design adopts the form of translucent small squares. Interior design toilet and sleeping space. There is a wide view near the river bank.
