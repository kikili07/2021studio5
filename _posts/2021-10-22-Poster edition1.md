Since my last poster was very lack of technical details, I reconsidered about the whole structure of my model and the materials as well.

For the materials, I decided lumber for the main frame of the house, steel for the outside stairs, and hempcrete for frame filling and insulation.

Hempcrete is a nice quality material for construction that has not been widly used yet. This material is made from lime and hemp shivs (a waste product from hemp fiber growing), which can be used for walls, floors, and for roof insulation. This material can breathe, absorb and release water, adjust internal humidity, and avoid water retention and mold growth. It also provides excellent acoustic and thermal insulation and thermal mass. In addition, this material is lightweight, reduces construction costs and it is environmentally friendly.

I firstly made a simple structure model of the building.

Then attached real texture onto the model

I also added some structural details on the sections and a new plan at 1.6m eye level. (the only plan from last poster is at 3m level )
